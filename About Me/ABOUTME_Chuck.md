Founder and Operator, Controlling Automation LLC | ICS Security Optimization

I am the founder and president of Controlling Automation LLC. 

For the last 20 years I have been working at the bleeding edge on organizing and optimizing automation systems. It is something I really love.

The focus of my professional knowledge, experience and ability is in building and transitioning machine and plant automated systemsinto high-performing, secure, optimized and integrated Industry 4.0 control and information systems. 

Technology and it's application has changed a lot over the past 5-10 years. Seeing and experiencing the opportunities and frustrations has inspired me to master building and conversion of systems andprocesses to enable stability and significant output of these systems. It's not easy, but I know how to get this done so people, processes and systems work together to achieve corporate goals.

Since I was very young I have loved electronic systems. My grandfather got me interested in Ham (amateur) Radio when I was 12 and became licensed. This exposed me to the adult world through world-wide communications with many kinds of people. 

As I grew older I learned about music (playing, singing and production), getting married, having kids, building a life, learning about how people work, learning about how I work and a myriad of other things including astint learning how to ballroom dance. 

The home I grew up in was at the edge of town. In the suburbs but with the rest of the world out the back door. Literally, on the other side of our small back yardwas a Michigan forest and farmlands. Back then I didn’t understand what I had. Year after year the seasonal changes; how the trees and animals acted throughout the year. It taught me how dynamic and integrated things really are.

Life is very difficult. It has moments of joy but only if we don’t run from the trouble that finds us. This manuscript is what I have found to work well in building a life God has designed for us.

I’m tired of seeing people lose. God made us winners. This is my best effort to simply guide.

Several years ago I went through a divorce. What I learned was that everyone around me went through it also. Especially my kids but also my future wife. I had to work for a very long time to restore and gain a proper life. The information I am sharing here is the result of many moments trial and error.

The information here is very specific. That was intentional to get you deep into the context of everything I’m sharing here. But you have your own mission and vision that God has given you. Map your own way and use as much of this as you want.
