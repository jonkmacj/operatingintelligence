## Controlling Automation LLC
An ICS Strategy, Consulting & Technology Company

We are passionate and highly skilled at bringing order, security and high-performance to automation systems. You need to be protected from a growing range of threats. We build in that protection with knowledge, engineering and direct action.

We create comprehensive ICS digital transformation, people/technology integration, optimization leading to high performance & extreme security in new and legacy automated systems.

We help you create new systems and rehab old ones to get the business & commercial goals you have. This is wide-spectrum, next-generation system integration across all aspects of people, machines and processes. This includes areas from industrial control systems (ICS) to standalone single-purpose systems where people interact increasingly with automated systems everyday. 

The end result is enabling your staff to construction of dynamic systems that are highly available, continuously optimized, secure and capable of delivering the information needed to make immediate and high performing business decisions.

"Operating Intelligence" ICS Management System on the Ignition Platform
The only way to keep things controlled, understood and verified is to know what you have, where it is and what it is doing. This is the essence of cyber security. These are easy things to say but very hard to do, especially at a large scale. This training, development and transformation program will guide you through what it will take to accomplish the requisite steps in an incremental manner.

### TARGET PRINCIPLES
- Smooth transition from current state to desired. Maintenance team will understand what has changed and how to interact with them.
- As much as possible, all controllers inter-connected. The architecture being clearly documented. This will allow for centralized access, future integration and possible high level HMI development for centralized visibility of system performance and data gathering/presenting.
- Simplification for mechanic quick understanding. Ultimate goal is quick understanding of what needs to be done to recover from downtime causing situation. This could include modifications to HMI screens to allow for faster diagnosis of common issues.
- Conform to ‘Ideal System Model’. Having a goal in mind of a system that is fully understood, robust with upgrade paths identified for a future proof overall system architecture.

### OPERATING VALUES
- Respect of people. I enjoy interacting with and solving problems with you.
- Teacher of solid fundamentals. I will enthusiastically share what I know.
- Situational sensitivity to understand what will and won’t work in specific environments.
- Subduing defective physical and process entities into a peaceful state, finding beauty in solution options.

### WHAT WE DO

> We train you and we help you install the program......

We create strategies, architectures and project plans for comprehensive digital transformation and system optimization in new and legacy automated systems. We use a blend of both traditional automation and IoT approaches, depending on multiple factors.

You have limited time and significant responsibilities. We came up with a product that will enable rapid review of your system. The result will be to show how to architect your system for high performance in all dimensions. 

We will help you simplify your systems and the information around it, enable them to run all the time and make it easy for you to know what's going on. 

We have a surefire way to hit huge uptime metrics, keep your customers utterly satisfied and setup a perpetual cycle of continuously improving all aspects of your people, processes and systems. Our approach will get your team engaged and keep them that way. Multi-dimensional training will make huge performance gains in them. You have goals to hit or contract terms to meet. Let us help you do this in the most robust and simplest way possible. Total elimination of the systemic issues is the goal. 

We help maintenance operations achieve operational excellence by teaching people how to build strong, high functioning relationships with each other and customers, operate with intelligent processes and expand their knowledge of automation systems. 

The result of this program will provide you with all the information required to upgrade your systems on your own or understand better how to do it with others. This is coursework developed with thousands of hours of experience and research. It is updated with new lessons learned and new technologies found to be proven. 

### PRIMARY OBJECTIVES 
INSTANT INFORMATION | RAPID RESOLUTION | COMPLETE CONFIDENCE 

Smart system modernization 
High performance operators & maintainers 
Excellence built into the infrastructure 
Transition to indestructibility…..Find the calm. Everything in place. 
A strategy, system, knowledge and workflow for setting up perfected infrastructure and keeping it all together. 
All the very best methods of setting up your plants control systems for HUGE stability! In Roadmap form…... 


### HOW WE DO IT
We do this through a knowledge framework we developed called “Operating Intelligence”, Microsoft Azure IoT built software systems and various, carefully chosen hardware manufacturer platforms. We setup a means to adapt to what you have.

We provide an online, on-demand and in-person relational engagement aimed at achieving operational excellence and creating a self-sustaining, continuous improvement cycle. The content is based on the industry's highest performing and most proven concepts mixed with site specific dynamics. We help bring confidence, new ideas and strong execution. 

We will walk through your systems together and make a clear, detailed plan you can have confidence in. Exhibits will be aquired, questions will be asked and it all will be laid out in an easy to understand plan. 

We will start with what goals or terms you need to achieve and move through a Lean/Six Sigma oriented process that ends with smart execution of intelligent solutions. The resulting changes could be with the behaviors of your people, what makes up your processes and/or the state/configuration of your system. Maybe people need training, maybe things need to be done in a different way, maybe systems or machines need to be reconfigured, modified or modernized.

When I started working in industrial automation I had no idea what it really would take to work in this area. Over the years, I have been able to see very clearly what it takes to see problems and their solutions very quickly.....most of the time. With my experiences behind me, I can now see what it takes to become an intelligent operator and manager of automated systems. 

I want the same for you. Surely you already are quite capable in many areas. Here I will help you organize the more complex, outlying aspects of your plant's automated systems. 

Only through many mistakes, frustrations and solutions is it obvious what working smart means. And only by experiencing this with other people can we move into this place. Expect that your efforts will produce intelligence you didn't have before. Following is a progression for different thinking. 

I want you to become an intelligent operator of the systems you are responsible for. It is entirely possible. You are already well on your way with a few blind spots we are all susceptible to. Know this though, it may well be a chaotic and confusing place to be at times. Having confidence and being intelligent are not nearly always the same. 

WE LOVE HELPING YOU PURSUE PERFECTION WITH YOUR PEOPLE, PROCESSES & AUTOMATED SYSTEMS!
